# VCore
VCore is a platform-independent Minecraft server plug-in library that was primarily designed for real-time synchronization in multiproxy networks via a global Redis cache. In addition to this framework, it offers platform-dependent library code that can relieve some of the work for e.g. Spigot plugins.

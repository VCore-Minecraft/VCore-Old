# VCore (Beta)

VCore is a platform-independent Minecraft server plug-in library that was primarily designed for real-time
synchronization with multiproxy networks via a global Redis cache. In addition to this framework, it offers
platform-dependent library code that can relieve some of the work for e.g. Spigot plugins.

This project is currently under heavy development. When there is a first stable version I will let you guys know.
